import requests
import time
import subprocess
import threading

def start_server():
    subprocess.run(['python', 'src/main.py'])

server_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_server, daemon=True)
server_thread.start()
time.sleep(3)

try:
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/init-buyers')
    print('Sample buyers initialized:', response.json())
except Exception as e:
